Revision history for Catalyst-Controller-DBIC-API: 2.004004

2.004004  2012-11-21 12:20:41 Europe/Vienna
- Fixed test failures in t/[rest,rpc]/item.t on newer HTTP::Message versions
- Don't wrap the SQLite test schema DDL queries in a transaction to suppress
  DBIx::Class warnings
- Added diagnostic messages to tests that trigger DBIx::Class warnings

2.004003  2011-12-19 14:41:59 Europe/Vienna
- Fixed test failure in generic.t with Moose > 2.02

2.004002  2011-10-24 15:48:55 Europe/Vienna

- Use the column accessor instead of set_column when inserting new objects
- Allow setting the result_class to undef to prevent the usage of HashRefInflator

2.004001  2011-08-19 16:17:53 Europe/Vienna

- Changed stored_model and stored_result_source attributes to methods for
  ACCEPT_CONTEXT/Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext compatibility

2.003002  2011-05-09 12:30:01 Europe/Vienna

- Added has_errors method
- Fixed tests to succeed with newer DBIx::Class and Moose versions
- Fixed controller instantiation failures with Moose 2 in relation to prefetch

2.003001  2011-02-16 17:52:37 Europe/Vienna

- Use JSON instead of JSON::Any to get rid of the CPAN Testers failures
  when only JSON::Syck is available

2.002004  2011-01-13 19:22:20 Europe/Vienna

- Renamed Visitor to Validator::Visitor to conform with Data::DPath::Validator
  and moved it into a separate file.
- Fixed failure because of Data::DPath >=0.41 by not using
  MooseX::Role::BuildInstanceOf for the validator attributes (RT#64673)
- Added result_class and stash_key attributes to Catalyst::Controller::DBIC::API,
  allowing the values of them to be derived from the controller configuration (RT#63686)

2.002003  2010-09-16 10:44:40 Europe/Vienna

- Added REST and RPC delete_bulk tests
- Fixed RPC delete_bulk not working at all
- Added REST and RPC update_bulk tests
- Removed useless RPC index action
- Fixed static configured page attribute not being used (RT#56226)
- Test use_json_boolean true
- Fixed search attribute generation for nonexistent relationships
- Remove trailing newlines from error messages

2.002002  2010-08-03 14:40:50 Europe/Vienna

- Fixed search for related columns overwriting existing params in generate_column_parameters
- Use column accessor for updating an existing object instead of passing the new values to update.
  This enables the column accessors to do additional work (for example with method modifiers).
- Fixed t/rpc/list.t error message regex to pass with Moose version >=1.05
- Fixed pod coverage and added a test for it

2.002001  2010-04-01 01:41:11 Europe/Berlin

- Remove debugging code and other noise from tests
- Fixed some typos and code cleanups
- Added possibility to fetch a single object by id + tests using 'item'
- Added item_root attribute which defaults to 'data' and is used as data root for 'item'
- Break out bulk actions into their own methods for RPC
- Restore identifer vs. no identifer for REST chains
- Chain dispatching has now been fixed to not be as hackish as before
- Shift around where the current result set is set. setup() now does /nothing/ by default other than be a chain anchor
- Tests added for updating related keys via REST
- generate_rs is now used to get the default resultset inside inflate_request
- No longer uses Catalyst::Action::REST to do dispatching instead uses ActionRole and MatchRequestMethod
- PLEASE THOROUGHLY TEST AS SOME BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE BEEN ALTERED SUBTLY WHEN DEALING WITH BULK vs SINGLE ACTIONS

2.001003  2010-02-12 19:01:56 America/Chicago

- Fill out some coercions to allow more complex search criteria (like sort order)
- Promote the helper functions into full methods
- Allow iterative customization by breaking down the save_objects into several discrete steps
- Make sure those steps also include $c

2.001002  2010-02-09 01:01:57 America/Chicago

- Fixed missing requirement for MooseX::Types::Structured
- Fixed MooseX::Aliases usage (we don't any more)
- Object inflation during end was broken out into its own method: each_object_inflate
- Enable offset based paging

2.001001
**************************************************************
** THIS RELEASE GUARANTEES TO BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY **
**************************************************************

- Merge create and update into update_or_create
- object is much advanced now:
      + Identifier can be omitted, and data_root in the request is interpreted
- Because of the above one object or several is now possible for update or create
- Create and Update object validation now happens iteratively
- Creates and Updates can be mixed inside a single bulk request
- All modifying actions on the database occur within an all-or-nothing transaction
- Much of the DBIC search parameter munging is properly moved to the RequestArguments 
    Role in the form of a trigger on 'search' to populate 'search_parameters' and 
    'search_attributes' which correspond directly to ->search($parameters, $attributes);
- Error handling is now much more consistent, using Try::Tiny everywhere possible
- Tests are now modernized and use JSON::Any
- Extending is now explicitly done via Moose method modifiers
- The only portion of the stash in use is to allow runtime definition of create/update_allows
- list is now broken down into several steps:
    + list_munge_parameters
    + list_perform_search
    + list_format_output
    + row_format_output (which is just a passthrough per row)
- Search can now take an array of hashrefs to give the ability to use the default 'OR' 
- By default search_parameters is an ArrayRef[HashRef] which is pertinent to list_munge_parameters
- More thorough documentation of the various bits and pieces.
    + Documentation now uses Pod::Weaver and Plugin::PodWeaver (weaver.ini added)
- The distribution is now managed by Dist::Zilla
- And some more likely forgotten.

1.004002
- Implement 'as' as a complement to 'select'
- CGI::Expand'ed search parameters are now also JSON decoded + test
- Fixed pod for parameters using a json string which shouldn't be surrounded
  by single quotes
- Use next instead of NEXT in RPC
- Moved sub object from RPC/REST to Base to DRY
  This will break your code if you subclass from REST
  and had relied on the action name 'object'
- Check for defined objects before returning them for create/update

1.004001
- Allow for more complex prefetch_allows (multiple keys in hash)
- Skip non-existant parameters in deserialization
- Fixed whitespace to use spaces instead of tabs
- Fixed pod to not use the config attributes from before 1.004
- Fixed prefetch_allows check to properly handle nested attrs + test

1.004000
- Moosify
- Move validation for *_exposes/*_allows to Data::DPath::Validator
- Reorganize internals to use Moose and roles
- Allow maximum configuration for what request parameters are named
- Properly handle JSON boolean values
- Earlier and more consistent validation of configuration and request parameters

1.003004
- Database errors are also handled for searches + tests
- Totalcount isn't included in the response if a db error occurs while fetching data
- Converted no_plan tests to done_testing (required Test::More 0.88)

1.003003
- Database errors are properly handled + test
- Fixed isa redefined warnings
- Fixed bug preventing compat with future Catalyst::Action::Deserialize versions

1.003002

- Fixed some tests weren't run in t/rpc/list.t
- Fixed wrong setup_dbic_args_method error message

- Minor fix to prevent failing test

1.003000

- Doc improvements

1.002000

- Added setup_dbic_args_method config option
- Added list_search_exposes config option
- Removed duplicate tests in t/rpc/list.t and t/rest/list.t

  and vice versa
- Added search by json
- Added pagination support

1.001000
- Added setup_list_method configuration flag (jshirley)
- Added support for setting config params in stash
- Added list_grouped_by, list_count and list_ordered_by config attributes
